# Code Coverage

    Code coverage is a term relating to unit tests, where you test in small units -> every method by itself



**Code Coverage tells you how much of your code is being tested ("covered") by your test cases. If you have a 50% test coverage, half or your code is covered.**

The total amount of lines are counted, if you miss to check a certain case, which is prone to happen if you use if-else-statements in your code, you will not be able to get a 100% code coverage.

##  So how much coverage is best? Do I need 100%?
It is important to mention that in some cases *you might not even want or need* 100% test coverage. Striving for the highest amount with the least effort will be your best bet. As a general rule about 85% coverage will suffice, though it really depends on the project.
